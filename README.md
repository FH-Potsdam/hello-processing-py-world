# hello-processing-py-world

Some sketches created @FH-Potsdam 2015.04.15 for showing some processing.py  

##hsb_mode

Shows how to use the `colorMode(HSB)` and draw `rect()` in a `for` loop. Makes use of `size()`
and `noStroke()`

##lines_from_side_to_side  

Draws `line()` in two `for` loops. Once from top to bottom. Once from left to right. Also makes use of `strokeWeight()`

##load_svg  

Uses `list` (in Processing it would be an `Array`) to store file names. Selects `random()` items from that list and draws them in `def draw():`. Also uses `noStroke()`, `frameRate()`, `fill()`, `rect()`, `int()`, `random()`, `len()`, `loadShape()` and `shape()` 

##simple_function  

Shows how to use def `setup():`, `def draw():` and how to declare own functions. Makes use of`beginShape()`, `endShape()` `vertex()` and `ellipse()`

##simple_loop_with_list  

Shows how to store values in a two dimensional `list` and how to access them. Makes use of `for` loops, `len()`, `list.append()`, `random()`, `int()` and `ellipse()`
